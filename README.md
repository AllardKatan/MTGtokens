# MTGtokens
A laser cutting template for commonly used tokens in Magic, The Gathering.

The file currently contains:
64 +1/+1 tokens
32 -1/-1 tokens
16 each of +-1/0, +-0/1, +-2/+-2, +-5/+-5
5 each of long keyword ability indicators
4 each of short keyword ability indicators

I found that these simple tokens were hard to find as a digital download for free, so I created them and put them here to share for all.
Haven't tried to actually make them yet, will update as I go along.

The template is meant to fit a 300x450 mm sheet of material. The source is the tokens.svg file, derived from this are a simplified svg ('flattened') with all groups and clones ungrouped and unlinked, a dxf which is derived from that file, and a png. The SVG and DXF hves three layers that are meant to be cut, and a comments/helpline layer. The text (grey), originally intended to be engraved, is probably best to write first, after this the vertical dividing arcs (blue), which is a cut layer, and finally the long horizontal dividers which cut the tokens out of the sheet.
